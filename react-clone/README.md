React Clone Task

This task is the practical task number 3, from T17 - Introducing React Elements and Components.

This tasks required:
Finding a published web page to create a clone using a React application.
Identifying the major components and sections of said web page.
Implement functional components for the different sections of the website.
Choose at least one functional compoment to pass props to another applicable components.
Apply custom CSS and Bootstrap components to style the webpage.

For this task, I chose to replicate the homepage of the Mirabeau website, a ros√© wine company based in Provence. The functional component passing props on this occasion are the section containing the social media widgets.

You can see the original web page hee.
